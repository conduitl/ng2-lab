##Express Server for Angular 2.0
Run with angular.io quickstart app. 

##TODOS
* App is to be barebones, yet I'm not confident yet that it has everything it needs. Need to test with various sample NG apps. 
* Need to understand how to routing is delegated between the Angular and the Express routers. For example, if I want one route to go to a static page served by Express, but the rest to be managed by the app.
