Guides worked through: 
* User Input
* Forms
* Dependency Injection

##Notes
###Dependency Injection
The factory service examples are not fully fleshed out. I'll need to revisit this concept to make sure I can fully grasp it and apply it. 
Topics for further review: 
* Alternative class providers
* Class provider with dependencies
* Aliased class providers
* Value providers
* Factory providers
* Dependency injection tokens
* Non class providers
* Opaque tokens
* Optional providers

###Template Syntax
I'm familiar with most of the tamplate syntax already; however, it makes sense to review how the internal mechanisms behind template syntax works more thoroughly. I'll go ahead and create a module which will be a playground for template syntax whenever I need to experiment or dive deeper.
